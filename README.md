## 💰 Invoice Flow

1. **Admin adds student**
2. **Admin defines fee structure** (e.g., tuition = ₹20,000, bus = ₹5,000)
3. **Admin creates invoice** for student (choose between full or installment)
4. System tracks due dates, sends reminders, and logs payment history
5. Invoice can be exported/downloaded and emailed
